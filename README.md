# ADS_assignment
This is the repository that consists of my ADS assignment. The code consists of 10 different functions that are solutions of the assignment. Each exercise is provided by the responding function name(for example task1(), task2, etc.)

How to Run:
1. Open `Main.java` in IntelliJ Idea or another Java IDE
2. In "main" function you see tests for each task, that are provided by functions(calling task1, task2, etc.)
3. Tests are commented, so you can decomment each test and run the program. By default, tests of task10 are not commented
